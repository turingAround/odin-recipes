        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by catching your clouds. Chase them with a butterfly net while riding a flying pig.</li>
            <li>Massage the clouds gently until they giggle. This releases the fluffiness.</li>
            <li>In a zero-gravity mixing bowl, combine unicorn giggles with stardust. Stir counterclockwise three times while hopping on one foot.</li>
            <li>Whisper your favorite knock-knock joke to the mixture. If it doesn't laugh, start over.</li>
            <li>Shape your cloud mixture into patties using telekinesis (or a spatula if your powers are weak today).</li>
            <li>Grill on the dark side of the moon for exactly 7 shooting stars.</li>
            <li>Toast your cotton candy bun under a phoenix's wing (medium flame).</li>
            <li>Stack ingredients in order of their magical properties, being careful not to wake the dreams.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately before it floats away.</li>
        </ol>
